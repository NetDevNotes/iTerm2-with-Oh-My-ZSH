# iterm2-with-oh-my-zsh
How to install iTerm2 and oh-my-zsh and why you might bother.

## What is iTerm2
Terminal in OSX is nice and simple but low on features. iTerm2 is a replacemnt for the Terminal built into a MAC, and offers many additional features, some of which listed below:

* Lots of keyboard shortcuts, so less time spent touching the mouse.
* Advanced split screens (horizontal/vertical)
* Mouseless copy
* Advanced command history
* Open iTerm2 from Finder
* Autocomplete list based on your input
* Instant Replay can take you back in time! But probably not to October 21st 1985.

> I'll go into more detail on some of the best features later in the artice.

## What is Oh-My-ZSH
Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (aka a shell, similar to bash).  Oh My Zsh is an open source framework for managing Zsh configuration. It also offers many additional features, some of which listed below:

* 250+ plugins that make using your favorite tools such as Ansible, GitHub, Python, Pyenv, easier and faster to use. 
* 140+ cool themes to make your terminal, such as iTerm2, look amazing.  
* You can even start your favourite track in Spotify from the command line. Why?  I dont know, but it was the first thing I did :smile:

## The power of team work!
So as you can imagine from listing just a few of the features iTerm2 and Oh-My-ZSH offer, you can probably understand why using both together is a powerful combination.

# Now What!?
We could go in many directions and depending on what you do may dictate your direction naturally.  But lets be honest, the first thing we are going to do is configure a Theme! :smile:
