# iterm2-with-oh-my-zsh
How to install iTerm2 and oh-my-zsh and why you might bother.

## What is iTerm2
Terminal in OSX is nice and simple but low on features. iTerm2 is a replacemnt for the Terminal built into a MAC, and offers many additional features, some of which listed below:

* Lots of keyboard shortcuts, so less time spent touching the mouse.
* Advanced split screens (horizontal/vertical)
* Mouseless copy
* Advanced command history
* Open iTerm2 from Finder
* Autocomplete list based on your input
* Instant Replay can take you back in time! But probably not to October 21st 1985.

> I'll go into more detail on some of the best features later in the artice.

## What is Oh-My-ZSH
Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (aka a shell, similar to bash).  Oh My Zsh is an open source framework for managing Zsh configuration. It also offers many additional features, some of which listed below:

* 250+ plugins that make using your favorite tools such as Ansible, GitHub, Python, Pyenv, easier and faster to use. 
* 140+ cool themes to make your terminal, such as iTerm2, look amazing.  
* You can even start your favourite track in Spotify from the command line. Why?  I dont know, but it was the first thing I did :smile:

## The power of team work!
So as you can imagine from listing just a few of the features iTerm2 and Oh-My-ZSH offer, you can see why using both together is a powerful match made in heaven :angel:
